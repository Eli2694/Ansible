### 🔹 Does `--diff` mode implement changes?

**Yes.**  
`--diff` alone will **apply** the changes and display the differences between the current and the new state.

- **Example:**
    
    ```bash
    ansible-playbook playbook.yml --diff
    ```
    
    This will:
    
    - Apply changes immediately.
        
    - Show differences for supported modules.

### 🔹 Difference Between `--diff` and `--check` mode:

|Mode|Applies Changes?|Shows Changes?|Purpose|
|---|---|---|---|
|`--diff`|✅ **Yes**|✅ Shows detailed changes|Applies and shows actual diffs|
|`--check`|❌ **No (Dry run)**|✅ Shows what would be changed (but no diffs)|Verifies without implementing changes|

---

### 🔹 Why combine both `--diff` and `--check`?

Using both together (`ansible-playbook playbook.yml --check --diff`) provides:

- **Safety:** Ensures **no changes** are applied, just simulated.
    
- **Clarity:** Shows exactly **what changes would be made** (detailed diffs).
    

**Recommended Command:**

```bash
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --check --diff
```

This approach is ideal for:

- Safely validating your playbook.
    
- Clearly previewing configuration file modifications.
    
- Reducing the risk of unintended changes.

### 📌 **Quick Summary:**

- **`--diff` alone:**  
    ✔️ Applies changes  
    ✔️ Shows detailed differences
    
- **`--check` alone:**  
    ❌ Doesn't apply changes  
    ❌ Doesn't show detailed diffs (only a summary of changes)
    
- **`--check --diff` together (recommended):**  
    ❌ No changes applied (safe!)  
    ✔️ Shows detailed changes clearly (best practice!)
    

Using both flags together is a best practice for safe and transparent Ansible automation.
