YAML’s Anchors and Aliases are powerful features that allow you to reuse or reference parts of your configuration. This helps avoid duplication and maintain consistency across your file.

### What Are Anchors?

- **Definition:**  
    Anchors let you mark a node (which can be a scalar, sequence, or mapping) for reuse later.
    
- **Syntax:**  
    An anchor is defined by `&` followed by an identifier.
    
- **Example:**
    
    ```yaml
    default: &default_settings
      retries: 3
      timeout: 30
    ```
    
    Here, `&default_settings` creates an anchor for the mapping containing `retries` and `timeout`.
    

### What Are Aliases?

- **Definition:**  
    Aliases allow you to reference a previously defined anchor.
    
- **Syntax:**  
    An alias is created by using `*` followed by the anchor name.
    
- **Example:**
    
    ```yaml
    service:
      <<: *default_settings
      endpoint: "https://api.example.com"
    ```
    
    In this example, `*default_settings` pulls in the mapping defined earlier, reusing those values within the `service` mapping. This keeps the configuration DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
    

### When to Use Anchors and Aliases

- **Avoiding Repetition:**  
    When you have several parts of a file that require similar or identical settings (like default configuration parameters), anchors and aliases simplify maintenance by centralizing those values.
    
- **Maintaining Consistency:**  
    Updating the anchor’s value automatically updates every alias that references it, reducing errors and inconsistency.
    
- **Complex Structures:**  
    They are particularly useful when your YAML file has nested or repetitive structures. For example, in a multi-environment configuration, you can define a default set of properties and then override only what is necessary per environment.
    

### Advanced Example with Merging

YAML also allows merging mappings using the `<<` syntax in conjunction with anchors and aliases:

```yaml
default: &default
  retries: 3
  timeout: 30

production:
  <<: *default
  endpoint: "https://prod.example.com"

development:
  <<: *default
  endpoint: "https://dev.example.com"
  debug: true
```

This advanced use-case shows how a common configuration can be extended or overridden for specific environments.
